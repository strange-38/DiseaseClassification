Medical Text Classification with Bio_ClinicalBERT
This project demonstrates how to use Bio_ClinicalBERT, a BERT-based transformer model pretrained on clinical and biomedical texts, for medical text classification. The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of medical abstracts extracted from doctor's prescriptions, aiming to classify them into disease categories.

Key Features
Bio_ClinicalBERT for medical text classification.
Fine-tuning with AdamW optimizer and cross-entropy loss.
Early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation with standard classification metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
